= Migrate Referenced Paths

A migrated configuration may reference paths, i.e. files and directories, which may need to be migrated to the target server.

A referenced path is migrated only if it's not an absolute path, and such migration consists in copying the resource to such path, but relative to the migrated configuration, in the target server.

The console logs a message noting the migrations of paths:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
 INFO  Referenced paths migrated.
