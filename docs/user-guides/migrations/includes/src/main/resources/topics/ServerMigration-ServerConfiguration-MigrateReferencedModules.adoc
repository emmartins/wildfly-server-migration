= Migrate Referenced Modules

A migrated configuration may reference and depend on a module that is not installed on the target server.
The tool automatically migrates the referenced modules, and their dependent modules as well.

The console logs a message noting the module ID for any module that is migrated, for example:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  Module cmtool.datasources:main migrated.
INFO  Module cmtool.ee1:main migrated.
INFO  Module cmtool.ee2:main migrated.
INFO  Module cmtool.naming:main migrated.
----

TIP: It is possible to *exclude* the migration of specific modules by specifying the id(s) in the environment property named `modules.excludes`.
