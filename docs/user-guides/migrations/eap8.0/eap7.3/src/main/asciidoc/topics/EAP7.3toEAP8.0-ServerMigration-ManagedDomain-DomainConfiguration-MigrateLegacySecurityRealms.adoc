= Migrate Legacy Security Realms

{server-target-productName} does not supports the legacy Security Realms framework, and the tool migrates any usage of such resources to instead use the default {server-target-productName} Elytron replacements.

Please note that further manual Elytron configuration may be needed if the legacy security realm(s) being used were not the {server-source-productName}'s defaults!

The console logs all configuration resources migrated to the default {server-target-productName} Elytron replacements, for each configuration profile.
