= Update the remoting Subsystem

One of the most relevant features introduced by {server-target-productName} is the new HTTP connector, a connector that is able to replace all legacy remoting protocols and ports, using a single port.
The HTTP Connector is configured in the *remoting* subsystem and the tool simply updates the subsystem configuration to activate it.

By default, the tool automatically updates the *remoting* subsystem.
If you prefer, you can set the `subsystem.remoting.update.skip` environment property to `true` to skip automatic update of the *remoting* subsystem configuration.

Upon successful migration of the *remoting* subsystem configuration, you should see the following message in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
 INFO  Subsystem remoting updated.
